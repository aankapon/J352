<p>At the University of Maryland, where journalism is one of its reputable majors, there are multiple student publications that have been established on campus. Student work is distributed amongst the likes of The Diamondback, Capital News Service, and The Black Explosion. But with how busy college gets, it may seem impossible for any other student on campus get to read the stories written by the journalism students. </p>
<p>However, junior electrical engineering major Nataraj Shivaprasad, who is the director of digital strategy at The Diamondback, says that students are still reading their stories. 
“Through our various social channels and relevant stories, we are able to have student readership,” says Shivaprasad. 
Shivaprasad’s job at The Diamondback consists of analyzing weekly engagements metrics across five social media platforms, compile comprehensive monthly analytics for presentation, and advising short- and long-term content strategies.</p>
<p>Using news metrics is important to know what direction a news publication is heading and to establish what kind image or niche the publication wants to tackle. </p>
<div class= "calloutstyle"> “Analytics are tools that can give powerful guidance on what to cover, how to cover it and how to better serve communities,” said Liz Worthington, Director of Product Strategy at API.</div>
<p> The Diamondback and The Black Explosion are two student print publications on University of Maryland focusing on the same topics, although The Black Explosion focuses a little more on cultural topics within the black community at UMD. According to the data, The Black Explosion had the most visits on their website on October 19th with about 350 visits. Overall, The Black Explosion averaged about 5.2K visits between the period of September and October. The Diamondback also had the most visits on their website on October 19th . Overall, The Diamondback averaged 7.9K page views between September and October. </p>
<p>As for video production, we have The Left Bench and Capital News Service. The Left Bench, a video news production that focuses on UMD athletics and Capital News Service is more broad focusing on UMD and the community surrounding the campus. Capital News Services’ most viewed video is a story on a DMV youth sports organization with 442 views. Overall CNS averaged 43.3 views per video and had a sum on 1,667 views for the month of October. The Left Bench’s most viewed video is a story about Maryland Volleyball winless conference play with 330 views. Overall, TLB had a sum of 1,980 views and averaged 132 views per video in the month of October.</p>
<p> Shivaprasad says the most interesting thing about news metrics is how people find stories. “It’s interesting to see what share of views come from organic search vs. social channels," he said. </p>
