<p> Navient is a federal student loan servicer in the United States that has been under fire recently for taking advantage of student loan borrowers. Starting 2017, Navient had a growing number of lawsuits.<br>
For my data, I decided to focus on the D.C metropolitan area, also known as the DMV and the debt collection complaints towards Navient. The D.C metropolitan area consists of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. For research purposes, I decided to include the whole state of Maryland and Virginia. <br>
 In the data, I have noticed that the bigger the state, the more complaints were discovered. Virginia has the largest population and is the bigger state of the three. The District of Columbia, which is not considered a state, has the smallest population and is the smallest of the three. Virginia’s highest complaint count was in April 2022, totaling 24 complaints, whereas Maryland’s highest complaint count was 17 in August 2022 and D.C’s highest was 8 in December 2021.<br>
I also measured the sub-issues against Navient. Majority of the complaints from each state said that the company was trying to collect the wrong amount of money. The measurement of the sub issues show me that Navient was trying to steal money from their customers. </p>
