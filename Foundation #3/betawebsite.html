          <h1>Campus Publications and Data: The Underatted PB&J</h1>
	  <p>A deep dive into how students and other residents are engaging with student written stories and how the student-run publications are using news metrics to engage with their audience.</p>

<p>At the University of Maryland, there is the Phillip Merrill College of Journalism: one of the top journalism schools in the nation. One of the practices Merrill College has that makes the school successful is the application of real world in their students’ education. Students are encouraged by professors to write or produce stories outside of class. Students gain that easy opportunity through the multiple student publications that UMD has.  Student work is distributed amongst the likes of The Diamondback, HerCampus, The Mitzpeh, and The Black Explosion. But with how busy college gets, it may seem impossible for any other student on campus get to read the stories written by Merrill Students. </p>
<p>Nataraj Shivaprasad, Director of digital strategy at The Diamondback, says that they have enough student to read their stories. 
“Through our various social channels and relevant stories, we are able to have student readership,” says Shivaprasad. 
Shivaprasad’s job at The Diamondback consists of analyzing weekly engagements metrics across five social media platforms, compile comprehensive monthly analytics for presentation, and advising short- and long-term content strategies.</p>
<p>Using news metrics is important to know what direction a news publication is heading and to establish what kind image or niche the publication wants to tackle. 
“Analytics are tools that can give powerful guidance on what to cover, how to cover it and how to better serve communities,” said Liz Worthington, Director of Product Strategy at API. </p>
<p> According to the data, The Black Explosion had the most visits on their website on October 19th with about 350 visits. Overall, The Black Explosion averaged about 5.2K visits between the period of September and October. The Diamondback also had the most visits on their website on October 19th . Overall, The Diamondback averaged 7.9K page views between September and October. </p>
<p>As for video production, we have The Left Bench and Capital News Service. Capital News Services’ most viewed video is a story on a DMV youth sports organization with 442 views. Overall CNS averaged 43.3 views per video and had a sum on 1,667 views for the month of October. The Left Bench’s most viewed video is a story about Maryland Volleyball winless conference play with 330 views. Overall, TLB had a sum of 1,980 views and averaged 132 views per video in the month of October.</p>
<p> Shivaprasad says the most interesting thing about news metrics is how people find The Diamondback’s story. “It’s interesting to see what share of views come from organic search vs. social channels," he said. </p>
